# ML_Covid_Dtetector
Covid-19 Detector using machine learning algorithms like xgboost or random forest

Detect covid-19 traces in patients by entering the basi vital parameters like temperature, difficulty in breathing, contact tracing etc.

Using XGBClassifier we get accuracy of 96.6% with RMSE of 0.1820
Using Random Forest Regressor we get accuracy of 95.4% with RMSE of 0.2014

The dataset is cleaned before use, and the information of parameters are given in
